Effect Of Drunk driving laws on traffic deaths.

In this project we evaluated the impacts of driving laws and other socio-economic factors on the vehicle fatality rates. We utilized data obtained by the U.S. Department of Transportation Fatal Accident Reporting System. The data is compiled for lower 48 states between years 1982 to 1988.

There are 39 features in this dataset. Out of them, 5 variables describe the laws, which were enacted by the state government. These are the tax on the case of beer, minimum legal drinking age, mandatory jail sentence, mandatory community service and percentage of population residing in dry counties. 13 variables account for the state economy: personal income, unemployment rate and drivers. The state governments cannot change these variables. We try to understand the effect of these variables on the fatality rates. The dataset also provides variables, which describe the proportion of religious communities like percentage of Southern Baptists and Mormons across different states. There are 15 variables, which provide information about the fatality rate across different age groups- 15-17 years, 18- 20 years and 21-24 years. Our project provides analysis based on two dependent variables, which are:
- MRALL- Vehicle Fatality Rate
- MRALLN-Night time Vehicle Fatality rate
